TIMERINO
===

## 2023 Update: as noted in [Daniele's comment](https://github.com/ciromattia/timerino/issues/3#issuecomment-1406243036) there's a v3.01 for Timerino further developed by Alessio Bortoletto which you can find [here](https://alessiobortoletto.wixsite.com/alessiobortoletto/projects-2).


**Timerino** is a programmable darkroom enlarger timer built upon an Arduino microcontroller.
Currently it has _linear_ and _geometric_ (f/stop) exposure functions.

Currently supports 2 models which differs only in the display:
 * *DL-series* has a 7-Segment 4-number LCD display and a 10-led bar
 * *CMG-series* has a 16x2 matrix LCD display
